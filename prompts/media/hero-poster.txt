Design a bold, minimal, high-contrast poster for a performance running supplement brand called MILE[21].

Style: "equipment for your bloodstream", serious road running, anti gym-bro. Editorial + technical manifest. Stark, minimal, brutal clarity.

Color palette ONLY:
- background: near-black #09090B
- main text: off-white #FAFAFA
- secondary text: gray #A1A1AA
- accent 1: redline #FF3B30 (use sparingly for emphasis)
- accent 2: oxygen cyan #22D3EE (use sparingly for signal/check)

Typography feel:
- Condensed heavy road-marking headline vibe (painted road stencil). Tight tracking. Big.
- Monospace for specs.

Copy to include:
- THE ANTIDOTE TO THE WALL.
- FULLY DISCLOSED // BATCH #001
- OXYGEN > ADRENALINE

Composition:
- Large wordmark MILE[21]
- 3 spec bullets with tiny icons: OXYGEN DRIVE, SMART SPEED, ZERO DRAG
- Include a small "UTAH EXCLUSIVE" stamp.

Output:
- Clean, print-like, no gradients, no photorealism, no 3D.
- Looks like a premium label / lab manifest.
