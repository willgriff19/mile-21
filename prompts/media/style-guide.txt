Brand: Mile 21. Audience: serious road runners (10k–marathon) who hate gym-bro preworkouts.
Positioning: “Equipment for your bloodstream.” Anti-adrenaline chaos. Oxygen delivery + calm relentless focus.

Visual language:
- Stark, minimal, technical, editorial. Looks like lab equipment + road markings.
- Avoid supplement clichés (explosions, neon, muscle imagery, gym scenes).

Color palette (STRICT):
- Void background: #09090B
- Card/tarmac: #18181B
- Line/borders: #27272A
- Primary text: #FAFAFA
- Secondary text: #A1A1AA
- Muted text: #52525B
- Redline accent (CTA + key data only): #FF3B30
- Oxygen signal accent (icons/checks only): #22D3EE

Typography:
- Headline vibe: painted road stencil / road marking. Condensed, heavy, tight tracking.
- Technical text vibe: monospace, uppercase labels, precise.

Content rules:
- Use redline ONLY for CTAs + key numeric data (e.g. “6.0g”, “100mg”, “$45”).
- Use oxygen cyan ONLY for checkmarks/icons.
- Keep everything else monochrome.

Negative constraints:
- No photoreal product jar, no lifestyle photos, no gradients/glow/3D.
- No additional colors beyond the palette.
- No medical claims. Use “supports” language.

Output format:
- Prefer clean poster/label layouts, vector/print feel.
- High contrast, readable, minimal.
