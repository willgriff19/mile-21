### Base prompt (start here)
Create a modern editorial logo for a premium endurance running supplement brand named “Mile 21”. The logo should feel credible and timeless, like a great magazine masthead meets a performance label. Clean vector design, high contrast, minimal, no gradients. Use off‑white paper background (#F8F5F1) with black ink (#1A1A1A) and optional single accent in brick red (#B94747). Include both:
- a wordmark: “Mile 21”
- a simple icon/mark that can stand alone at small sizes.

The mark should subtly reference running and the marathon “wall” without clichés: think mile marker, course line, elevation/grade, negative split, or a stamped batch seal. Avoid dumbbells, flames, skulls, lightning, generic wings.

Deliver: 6 distinct variations on one sheet, aligned on a grid, each labeled.

---

### Variation A — Wordmark-first (editorial)
Design an editorial wordmark “Mile 21” using a sharp serif or high-quality italic serif, with a small mono “BATCH” tag as a secondary element. Minimal and premium. The icon should be a tiny mile marker or “21” monogram that matches the type.

### Variation B — Stamp / seal (batch feeling)
Create a circular or rectangular stamped seal logo: “MILE 21” + “BETA BATCH” + “ROAD RUNNING” + “FULLY DISCLOSED”. Looks like a printed quality stamp on paper. Include a clean “21” centerpiece.

### Variation C — Mile marker icon
Create a simplified mile marker icon that reads as “21” and feels like road running signage. Pair with a clean sans wordmark.

### Variation D — “21” monogram
Create a distinctive “21” monogram that can be embroidered or printed at 16px. It should feel like a heritage running club mark, but modern.

### Variation E — Course line / map mark
Create an abstract course line icon (single continuous line) that forms “21” or hints at a route profile. Pair with “Mile 21” in a confident editorial wordmark.

### Quick evaluation checklist
- Legible at 16–24px?
